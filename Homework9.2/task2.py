Goal of Task 2:
    Implement a function that identifies if a provided path collides with a track boundary.

Hint:
    In order to properly run the code in this homework, additional packages have to be installed via pip.
    Use:
        `pip install trajectory-planning-helpers`
        `pip install scenario-testing-tools`

    # Task:
    # ToDo: Identify if a provided path collides with a track boundary. Both, the path and the boundary, are provided
    #  as a sequence of coordinates connected by straights. This function can then be used to detect collisions with
    #  any of the track boundaries. Cases where the trajectory itself does not hit a bound, but a side of the vehicle
    #  would touch the boundary must also be detected.
    # Hints:
    #   - For this implementation we recommend the library "shapely" (documentation: shapely.readthedocs.io) with the
    #     following useful methods for this task:
    #       - buffer (inflate a given shapely object for a specified increment)
    #       - intersect (check whether two shapely objects intersect at any point)
    #   - the provided array (bound and path) can be directly converted to a shapely object via
    #     'shapely.geometry.LineString(path)'.
    #   - It should be noted, that the problem is significantly reduced in complexity for this course, the following
    #     assumptions hold:
    #       - The vehicle length is not considered
    #       - The vehicle kinematics are not considered (e.g. sheer off behavior)
